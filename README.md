# ðŸ“ˆ LSTM Stock Price Prediction Pipeline

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for forecasting next-day end-of-day stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. It includes data loading, preprocessing, technical indicator enrichment, normalization, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

## Features

- Loads historical stock data and enriches it with technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, Momentum, etc.)
- Preprocesses and normalizes features for LSTM input
- Trains an LSTM model to predict next-day closing prices
- Evaluates model performance (RMSE, MAE, Directional Accuracy)
- Analyzes feature importance via feature drop analysis
- Outputs evaluation tables and plots for further analysis
